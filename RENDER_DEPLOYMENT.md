# Render Deployment Configuration

## Fixed Issues

1. **PostCSS Configuration Error** - Removed duplicate `postcss.config.js` file, now using only `postcss.config.mjs`
2. **React Hooks in Server Components** - Added `"use client"` directive to `src/App.tsx`
3. **React Router Dependency** - Removed `react-router-dom` as Next.js has built-in routing
4. **Dependency Conflicts** - Updated `vaul` package to version 1.1.1 for React 19 compatibility
5. **Static Export Configuration** - Added `output: 'export'` to `next.config.mjs`

## Render Configuration

### For Static Site Deployment:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Publish Directory:**
```
out
```

**Environment:**
- Node Version: 22.x (or leave as default)

### Build Process

The build script now includes:
1. Installation of dependencies with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
2. Next.js static export build
3. Output to `out` directory

### Important Notes

- The site is configured for static export (no server-side features)
- All pages are pre-rendered at build time
- Images are optimized using `unoptimized: true` for static hosting
- The navigation uses simple state management instead of routing

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. In Render dashboard, create a new "Static Site"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set build command: `npm run build`
5. Set publish directory: `out`
6. Deploy!

## Testing Locally

To test the static export locally:

```bash
npm run build
cd out
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080
